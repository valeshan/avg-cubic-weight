# avg-cubic-weight

This CLI app accesses data through an API, and filters for objects in the air conditioner category. It then uses the dimensions within each object to create a cubic weight and places it into an array. Finally, the values within the array are added and divided to create the average cubic weight of all air conditioners.

## Setup

First, download the file and then unzip, within your CLI, go into the specified folder directory and type in ```npm install``` to install the required dependency, node-fetch.

Once the dependency as been installed, enter ``` node app.js``` to get the average weight value of the air conditioners in your console.
